	      <h2>Oregon Summer Fun To Remember</h3>


			<p>

			Beginning in late May, the Columbia Gorge Express will transport visitors from the Gateway Transit Center in Portland to Multnomah Falls and Rooster Rock State Park for just $5 round-trip. The bus service departs Gateway 12 times each day Friday through Sunday until the end of September. Cyclists can even get aboard with three bike spaces on each bus.
			</p>

			<p>
			America's Hub World Tours offers an eight-and-a-half hour tour priced at $90, with pre-arranged pickups and drop-offs from downtown Portland. The tour covers each of the Gray Line's stops, plus more at Timberline Lodge, Crown Point Vista House and Hood River, where visitors can explore on their own for lunch, shopping and wine tasting before hopping on for the return trip.
			</p>

			<p>
			By Bike:</p>
			Getting to the Gorge by bike is highly recommended. For starters, it is 19 miles of great views from the Gresham MAX station to Multnomah Falls.
			</p>
			<p>

			True cyclists will love riding the entire 100-year-old Historic Columbia River Highway, with a connecting motorized-vehicle-free state trail on parts of the old highway. The Troutdale to Cascade Locks segment passes by seven waterfalls, Crown Point Vista House and the Bridge of the Gods. The following Cascade Locks to Hood River segment features a new car-free segment of the restored state trail from Starvation Creek Trailhead to Viento State Park. The Hood River to The Dalles segment includes a beautiful 4-mile car-free leg that goes through the Mosier Twin Tunnels, followed by a ride to the picture-worthy Rowena Crest Viewpoint and Columbia Gorge Discovery Center. (Tip: avoid crowds at the pit-stops by taking the reverse route, starting in The Dalles and ending in Portland.)
			</p>
			<p>

			Even where you share the road with auto traffic, low speed limits and scenic views make it a must for experienced road cyclists. Find handy maps with detailed elevations, route cues and scenic points of interest from the Oregon Department of Transportation and Portland Office of Transportation.
			</p>

			However you get to the Gorge, there's plenty to discover all summer long, including special hikes, bike rides, runs, concerts, festivals, parades and other centennial celebration events. Check out the visitor page for maps and other attractions.<p>
